--------------------------------------------------


## Histology Data Cleaning Steps: 

1. slide_label column used to create Virus, Timepoint, UW_Line columns
2. Mating and RIX_ID columns created and populated based on matching UWID in weight data file
3. Column names are standardized (see WNV_Data_Dictionary.xlsx spreadsheet)
4. Unique IDs are created by appending the Mating and RIX_ID
5. Duplicates identified
6. ND values set to missing values; Notes updated to reflect ND values
7. Missing values set to 0 if subtotals are present
8. Subtotals and Total score recalculated
9. Tissue column added
10. GI_Lesions column added for non-brain samples (0/1 values)

### Specific Histology Data Corrections / Modifications

1. Duplicates removed (line 55, D4 animals)
2. For line 36, slide_labels were corrected for D12 mocks.
3. For line 30, slide_labels were corrected (2.3M changed to 3.2M; and 3.12 changed to 2.12 for RIX_ID 74)
4. For line 58, slide label 3.12 changed to 3.12M for RIX_ID 156
5. For line 39, remove duplicate animals 143 (1.12M) and 145 (2.12M).
6. For line 39, animal 142 (3.12) scores set to NA. Needs to be re-scored, since scores from duplicate samples do not agree.
7. For line 38, scores for animals 101 (2.7) and 102 (3.7) set to NA. Needs to be re-scored, since scores from duplicate samples do not agree.
8. Removed line 51
9. For additional line 9 animals, IDs changed from 1,2,3 to 4,5,6.

7. Calculate weight change percentages, add D0_Percentage column and set to baseline 0
8. Add Flag_Weight_Drop column (True if animals lost 20% body weight)
9. Add Flag_Identical_Weights (True if identical weights on consecutive measurements)
10. Add Flag_Per_Day_Weight_Change (True if weight change > 10% on consecutive measurements)
11. Add Flag_weight_day where Timepoint is >= 3 more than putative death day (day the weights are recorded up to) (internal check)
12. Add Flag_weight_date where death day > timepoint, (internal check)
13. Order columns according to the data dictionary
14. Annotate array_exists column

## Flow Cytometry Data Cleaning Steps: 

1. Non-numeric characters (special characters; e.g. Â¥) where numeric values are expected are set to NA (missing)
2. Column names are standardized (see WNV_Data_Dictionary.xlsx spreadsheet)
3. Matings, RIX_IDs, and time points are compared to a master list (from weight data). Mating formatting is fixed (no spaces; lowercase x)
4. Unique IDs are recreated by appending the Mating and RIX_ID
5. A Virus column is created from time points, and time points are then converted to numeric values (removing 'd' and 'm')
6. Add Data_Altered and Notes columns

### Specific Flow Data Corrections / Modifications (other than formatting mentioned above):

1. For files uploaded on June 17th, 2015, the Time variable on the Treg and T-cell panels was assumed to be 100. ***Note: as "Expt" files have been uploaded, I've noticed that the Time=100 assumption is not always correct. It may be best to upload all the older data as "Expt" files.
2. Data in files uploaded on June 17th, 2015 is overwritten by data in Experiment files
3. In Expt 7 and 8, animals labelled "mock" were removed
4. For animals 7, 8, and 32 from UW line 18, the time points were changed to d28 mock
5. For animals 4 and 6 from UW line 18 (18042x16513), the time points were changed to d28
6. For Expt 60, the mating for line 42 was corrected (8008x8016)
7. For Expt 64, the mating for line 68 was corrected (4410x3460) for d21 animals
8. For Expt 12, 13, and 14, the mating for line 12 was corrected (3252x8042)
9. For Expt 70, 71, and 72, the mating for line 71 was corrected (3564x8027)
10. For Expt 37, matings for line 18 were corrected (18042x16513)
11. For Expt 86, matings for line 50 were corrected (16680x8016)
12. For Expt 88, timepoints for line 86 were corrected (animals 49, 54, 58 changed to d12)

### Cleaned Data Files

1. Lund_Flow_21-Mar-2016_final.xlsx
    - This file contains only the cell population percentages in the original files
2. Lund_Flow_Full_21-Mar-2016_final.xlsx
    - This file contains the percentages, the calculated cell counts ('count' appended to variable name), and ratios for the ICS panel ('ratio' for ratio of percentages and 'ratio_count' for ratio of counts)
3. Lund_Flow_Heritability_21-Mar-2016_final.xlsx 
    - Heritability estimates for all flow variables, calculated using all animals and mocks only
